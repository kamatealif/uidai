✅ What “Winning” Looks Like (Judge POV)

A winning submission does 3 things:

1) Insight (What is happening?)

Trends, distributions, hotspots

2) Why (What could cause it?)

plausible operational/societal causes

3) Action (What should UIDAI do?)

clear actionable steps + monitoring indicators

You’ll deliver all three.
